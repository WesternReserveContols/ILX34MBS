I am having trouble with the Authenticity DEV API with the code that was working last Spring.  I discovered there were some API changes made earlier that spring for which I must have missed the communication/notification of that change.  Last I knew in April, the PROD API was not yet stable???  This time both my Postman file from 4/14/2022 and my Excel VBA macro that were working, no longer work.  The Postman seem to refuse to accept my data header format even though I copied the format given directly form the reply message.  I also found if a quotation mark (â€œ)  is prepended, I get a different message in the reply.  My Excel VBA seem to be complaining about client credentials even though these credentials worked before and are the same as used in Postman.

Please see the attached Excel workbook for the details of these issues.  I did this in Excel so you could easily copy my strings for your analysis convenience.

Have there been any changes to the API since Last April that I may not be aware of?  Since the DEV API was not working to verify my data, I did not try the PROD API.
